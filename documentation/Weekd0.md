## Tree Challenge
This is the code for the tree. The user inputs the desired height, then the tree is displayed using 1s until the height is reached, in which the trunk is built with the straight vertical line key on the keyboard.

## Animation
This is the animation that we were supposed to make by ourselves. Using the model set for us, we made a face animation that changes. Next time, we hope to use iteration for this.
