This is the data within my InfoDB array. The array is emptied out, then info is appended into the array through the command "infoDB.append".

This is what prints the data in the InfoDB loop. Three different loops are printed: a for loop, a while loop, and a recursive loop. All of the above are in reference to infoDB.

This is the fibonacci code. It is a recursion loop similar to the one used with infoDB.

This is the animation that we were supposed to make by ourselves. Using the model set for us, we made a face animation that changes. Next time, we hope to use iteration for this.

This is the code for the tree. The user inputs the desired height, then the tree is displayed using 1s until the height is reached, in which the trunk is built with the straight vertical line key on the keyboard.
