# Test Corrections

## Quiz 1
Question 13: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q13.PNG>
C is the right answer because the weather is not able to be tracked through the collars.

Question 24: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q24.PNG>
A is the right answer because metadata does not contain a key needed to decrypt the data. Metadata is used for routing of data.

Question 28: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q28.PNG>
D is the right answer because data compression can result in cons like loss of quality, but it can also have pros like less usage of storage.

Question 36: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q36.PNG>
A is the right answer because the database stores information on item identification numbers and quantities available, the retailer can search for all item identification numbers that have a quantity of 0.

Question 39: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q39.PNG>
C is the right answer because there are only two processors running, meaning that you add the smallest value times to run the respective processes in order to find the minimum amount of time

Question 44: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q44.PNG>
A is the right answer because phishing attacks are characterized by a communication from a person trying to trick another person into divulging personal information. Because the phone number on a bank card is public information and not personal, this request does not indicate a phishing attack.

Question 50: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/1q50.PNG>
C is the right answer because if a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored.

## Quiz 2
Question 8: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q8.PNG>
C is the right answer because open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users.

Question 20: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q20.PNG>
D is the right answer because users with visual impairments can set their personal preferences to make text easier for them to read. These users can also enable text-to-speech to allow them to listen to text.

Question 22: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q22.PNG>
B is the right answer because IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected.

Question 27: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q27.PNG>
D is the right answer because incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.

Question 40: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q40.PNG>
D is the right answer because citizen science involves members of the general public participating in scientific research. Distributing the image analysis work to a larger group of individuals allows the work to be completed in less time.

QUestion 41: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q41.PNG>
D is the right answer because for each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined.

Question 43: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q43.PNG>
A is the right answer because the given code segment initializes count to 1 and increments count at the end of the outer loop. This causes the robot to move 1 square forward, then rotate left, then move 2 squares forward, then rotate left, then move 3 squares forward, then rotate left, then move 4 squares forward, then rotate left. The robot ends in the lower-right corner of the grid, facing toward the top of the grid. This code segment initializes count to 0 and increments count at the beginning of the outer loop. Because count is initialized to 0 and then immediately incremented inside the loop, the inner loop iterates the same number of times for each iteration of the outer loop as in the given code segment. The robot ends in the lower-right corner of the grid, facing toward the top of the grid.

Question 45: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q45.PNG>
A is the right answer because the desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students in spreadsheet I.

Question 46: <img src=https://github.com/peacekeeper6/Jun-CSP-Project/blob/gh-pages/assets/2q46.PNG>
C is the other right answer because as any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to contribute.
